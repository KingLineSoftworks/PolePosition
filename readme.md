# Pole Position
Pole Position is a project that aims to simulate the mechanics of automobiles.
The goal is to accurately simulate the workings of all parts, from IC engines to suspension.
Pole Position hopes to be used for engineering purposes, to virtually test and iterate, and for training purposes, in a virtual racing environment.

This project utilizes the [Quartz Engine](https://github.com/KingLineSoftworks/Quartz.git) and acts as a demonstration for how to use the Quartz Engine for your application.

## Building
This project is built with cmake. Create a build directory (`.build/`), `cd` into it and run `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` then `ninja`.
